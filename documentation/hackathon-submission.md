# MvxLib - MultiversX Hackathon Submission

## Project Overview

MvxLib is an open-source web application designed to simplify the discovery, exploration, and interaction with SDKs and ABIs within the MultiversX ecosystem. It provides a centralized platform that enables both beginner and experienced developers to learn, test, and interact with the MultiversX blockchain in an intuitive and educational environment.

## Team

- Lead Developer: Sylla
- Team Size: 1

## Open Source

MvxLib is fully open-source under the MIT License. The complete codebase is available on GitHub, promoting collaboration and community contribution to enhance the MultiversX developer ecosystem.

## AI Integration

Our application integrates AI in multiple significant ways:

1. **AI-Powered SDK Exploration Assistant**:
   - Implemented using Google's Gemini AI through the `@google/generative-ai` SDK
   - Provides contextual assistance for developers working with MultiversX SDKs
   - Helps interpret ABI functions and suggests best practices for implementation
   - Responds to MultiversX-specific technical questions to facilitate learning

2. **AI-Assisted Code Generation**:
   - Generates code examples for SDK interactions based on the developer's specific needs
   - Supports multiple programming languages commonly used with MultiversX
   - Adapts examples according to the developer's technical level, from beginner to advanced

## MultiversX Integration

The application integrates with the MultiversX blockchain in several ways:

1. **Blockchain Network Support**:
   - Full support for all MultiversX networks (Mainnet, Devnet, Testnet)
   - Network switching capabilities to facilitate testing and learning

2. **Smart Contract Interaction**:
   - Dynamic ABI explorer that automatically generates interfaces for smart contract interaction
   - Support for contract deployment, queries, and transaction execution
   - Educational visualizations explaining each step of the process

3. **SDK Exploration**:
   - Comprehensive catalog of MultiversX SDKs with documentation and usage examples
   - Interactive testing environment for SDK functions
   - Progressive learning paths adapted to different skill levels

### System Architecture:

1. **Component-Based Structure**:
   - Modular design with reusable components
   - Server and Client components using React 19's latest patterns

2. **Data Flow**:
   - API-first approach with clear data schemas
   - Real-time interactions with MultiversX blockchain

3. **AI Implementation**:
   - Secure backend processing of AI requests
   - Contextual help systems for progressive learning

## Project Vision & Impact

MvxLib addresses key challenges in the MultiversX ecosystem:

1. **Developer Onboarding**: Significantly reduces the learning curve for new developers by providing interactive tools to understand and use MultiversX SDKs.

2. **Rapid Prototyping**: Enables developers of all skill levels to quickly test concepts and interact with smart contracts without extensive setup.

3. **Community Knowledge Sharing**: Facilitates the sharing of components and knowledge across the MultiversX developer community.

4. **AI-Enhanced Development**: Leverages AI to help developers understand complex blockchain concepts and implement them correctly, accelerating their technical progress.

5. **Gateway for Beginners**: Offers an accessible entry point for developers discovering MultiversX, with clear explanations and progressive practical examples.

## Future Development Roadmap

1. **Short-term (1-3 months)**:
   - Enhanced AI capabilities for more context-aware assistance
   - Expanded SDK library with more examples
   - Improved user experience based on community feedback
   - Community contributions system

2. **Medium-term (3-6 months)**:
   - Integration with MultiversX IDE tools
   - Support for complex multi-contract interactions
   - Guided learning paths for different use cases

3. **Long-term (6+ months)**:
   - AI-powered smart contract analysis and security auditing
   - Advanced visualization tools for blockchain data
   - Comprehensive learning paths for developers of all levels
   - Integrated MultiversX skills certification

## How to Run the Prototype

### Prerequisites:
