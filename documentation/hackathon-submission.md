Each SDK listing includes:
- Brief description and key features
- Supported platforms and languages
- GitHub stars and activity metrics
- Community rating and feedback

### 2. SDK and ABI Analyzer

Once developers select an SDK or ABI, they can explore it in depth through our analyzer:

- **Repository Structure Visualization**: Interactive tree view of the repository structure
- **Code Browser**: Syntax-highlighted view of code files with smart navigation
- **Documentation Viewer**: Integrated documentation display with contextual AI assistance
- **Function Explorer**: Browse available functions and methods with detailed parameter information

The analyzer includes these features:
- Automatic identification of key components
- Contextual AI explanations of complex code sections
- Links between related functions and dependencies
- Search functionality to quickly locate specific features

### 3. Endpoint Testing Laboratory

The testing laboratory enables developers to experiment with SDK functions and smart contract endpoints:

- **Dynamic Form Generation**: Automatically generated input forms based on ABI specifications
- **Parameter Validation**: Real-time validation of parameters with helpful error messages
- **Network Selection**: Easily switch between Mainnet, Testnet, and Devnet
- **Transaction Simulation**: Preview transaction effects before execution
- **Result Visualization**: Clear display of execution results with explanation of return values

Developers can:
- Save test configurations for future use
- Share test setups with other developers
- Export working code examples based on their tests
- Track transaction history during testing sessions

### 4. Community Component Library

The component library offers ready-to-use components that can be integrated into MultiversX projects:

- **Categorized Components**: Browse components by category (UI elements, smart contract templates, etc.)
- **Preview System**: Interactive previews of components before download
